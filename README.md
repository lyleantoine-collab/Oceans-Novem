# Ocean's Novem – PFAS Bioremediation Cocktail

A no-bullshit, open-source, multi-strain microbial blend designed to actually degrade (not just bind) the majority of PFAS “forever chemicals” in soil and groundwater.

9 carefully selected bacterial + fungal strains that work together to attack short-chain, long-chain, and precursor PFAS under real-world conditions (including cold Canadian climates).

Because isolating them forever is the same old corporate cop-out. We want them gone.

## The Novem Crew (current line-up)
1. Pseudomonas sp. – classic fluoro-bond cleaver  
2. Labrys portucalensis – PFOA/PFOS destroyer  
3. Rhodococcus sp. – biofilm buster & long-chain specialist  
4. Dehalococcoides sp. – reductive defluorination beast  
5. Desulfovibrio/ Sulfurospirillum blend – anaerobic heavy lifter  
6. Azoarcus sp. – short-chain & GenX muncher  
7. White-rot fungus (Phanerochaete chrysosporium) – oxidative pre-treatment  
8. Bacillus subtilis – spore-forming survivor & nutrient cycler  
9. Methylocystis sp. – methanotroph sidekick for co-contaminants  

## Why 9?
9 strains = maximum coverage with minimum in-culture competition.  
9 = Novem = November = St. John’s, Newfoundland, where this madness was born.

## Goal
KISS protocol: brew cheap, spray or inject, walk away, let the microbes finish the job.

Garage-lab to pilot-scale recipes coming soon.  
Everything here is MIT-licensed – take it, improve it, deploy it, save the water.

Ocean’s Novem – because the only thing forever should be clean water.

Mahsi cho & let’s degrade some bullshit.
