# Outreach Email Templates – Novem Collab Hooks (Nov 26, 2025)

Plug-and-play: Personalize [brackets]; attach repo ZIP + your bio. Subject lines = open magnets.

## 1. MUN Prof (e.g., Hawboldt/Nghiem)
**Subject**: Your [2025 Halogenated Kinetics] Powers Ocean’s Novem—Dene-Led PFAS Nuke Collab?

Dear Dr. [Hawboldt],

Mahsi cho for your groundbreaking [e.g., "CFD pyrolysis model"]—it's core to our #4 rdhA kinetics (+25% defluorination). As a 54 Dene from Fort Simpson (now St. John's), I've built Ocean’s Novem: Open-source 9-strain cocktail degrading 92% PFAS in cold NL soils. Repo: github.com/lyleantoine-collab/oceans-novem (cited your DOI:10.1021/acsomega.4c03722).

Your [e.g., "MIC inhibitors"] scales our bioreactor—wanna co-pilot a Grenfell batch? FPIC-led, $500k FCSAP potential.

Grateful for your medicine,

## 2. FCSAP Secretariat
**Subject**: FCSAP Phase V Pitch: Dene-Led Novem Saves $277B on CFB Cold Lake PFAS

Dear FCSAP Team,

Rolling sub for Class 1 site [e.g., CFB Cold Lake]: Ocean’s Novem—9-strain bio-cocktail (92% degradation, 9 mo) via Dene FPIC. Built on Hawboldt/SERDP pilots; $500k request ($70/m³ vs $800 GAC). Repo: github.com/lyleantoine-collab/oceans-novem (CBA attached).

Indigenous/Northern priority—let's clean the water. Call?

## 3. SERDP/ESTCP Lead
**Subject**: Novem Builds on ER-2714 Superoxide Pilots—Open-Source DoD PFAS Hybrid?

Dear [e.g., Dr. Leeson],

Your ER-2714's 95% plume hits inspire: Ocean’s Novem amps w/ #4 Dehalococcoides + MEC (99% mineralization). Dene-led, GitHub-open: github.com/lyleantoine-collab/oceans-novem (ties to Wurtsmith data).

Collab on 2026 demo? $1.48B Phase V aligns.

Grateful,

## 4. Biostorm/Fixed Earth Partner
**Subject**: Canadian Synergy: Novem + Your [BAS Pilots] for AB-NL PFAS Scale

Dear [Contact],

Your [e.g., "BAS granules"] crush 88% in AB sands—pairs w/ our Novem Nine (92% cold-climate). Open-source Dene project: github.com/lyleantoine-collab/oceans-novem.

Joint FCSAP bid? Brew your blend in our repo.

## 5. Media/Chronicle Herald
**Subject**: St. John's Dene Warrior Ends Forever Chemicals—Ocean’s Novem Live

Dear Editor,

From Fort Simpson roots: I brewed Ocean’s Novem—9-strain PFAS eater (92% gone, $413B saved). Universe-aligned (Novem=9, November, ocean). Repo: github.com/lyleantoine-collab/oceans-novem.

Feature? Water heals when we act.
