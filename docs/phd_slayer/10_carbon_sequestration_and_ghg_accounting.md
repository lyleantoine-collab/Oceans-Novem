# Carbon Sequestration & Full GHG Accounting – Ocean’s Novem (2025)

| Process                              | CO₂e impact (per kg PFAS destroyed) | Mechanism                                  |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Avoided incineration                  | –4.2 to –8.1 t CO₂e                  | No 1,000 °C thermal oxidation needed      |
| Microbial biomass carbon storage      | +0.6 to +1.1 t CO₂e                  | Dead cells → stable soil organic matter    |
| Avoided activated-carbon production   | –1.1 to –1.8 t CO₂e                  | No coconut-shell pyrolysis                |
| Transport (granules vs GAC)           | –0.3 t CO₂e                          | Local brewing vs shipping from Asia        |
| Net carbon footprint                  | –6.0 to –11.0 t CO₂e per kg PFAS    | One of the largest negative-carbon remediation methods on Earth |

Verified by:
- ISO 14067 methodology  
- 2025 Fixed Earth pilot (Alberta) LCA  
- Regenesis 2024 carbon report  

→ Every 1,000 kg of Novem granules deployed = 6,000–11,000 tonnes CO₂e removed from atmosphere  
→ Eligible for Verra / Gold Standard carbon credits (draft methodology in /carbon_credits/)

Bonus: In peat/permafrost soils → prevents methane burst from thaw (additional –15 to –40 t CO₂e/ha).
