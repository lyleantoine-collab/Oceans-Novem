# PFAS Health Impacts – Why Ocean’s Novem is Urgent Public Health Intervention

| Effect                          | Strength of evidence (2025) | Blood level linked | Canadian exposure |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Immune suppression (↓ vaccine response) | Strong (Lancet 2024)       | >4 ng/mL           | 68 % of Canadians |
| Increased cholesterol           | Strong                      | >10 ng/mL          | 45 % exceed      |
| Liver damage (ALT elevation)    | Strong                      | >5 ng/mL           | Widespread       |
| Thyroid disease                 | Strong                      | >6 ng/mL           | Northern communities highest |
| Testicular + kidney cancer     | Sufficient (IARC 2024)      | >20 ng/mL          | Firefighters, military |
| Developmental (↓ birth weight)  | Strong                      | Maternal >5 ng/mL  | Inuit cord blood >15 ng/mL |
| Ulcerative colitis              | Sufficient                  | High PFOS          | Emerging         |

Canadian blood data (CHMS 2023–2025):  
- Northern Indigenous average = 28.4 ng/mL PFOS (highest on Earth)  
- St. John’s average = 8.7 ng/mL  

→ Every 1 µg/L removed from drinking water prevents ~1,400 excess cancer cases lifetime (Health Canada 2025 estimate)
