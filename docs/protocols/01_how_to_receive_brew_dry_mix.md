# Protocol 01 – From Glass Vial to 100 kg Dry Granules (KISS version)

Step 1 – Receive the vials (week 0)  
→ Freeze-dried powder arrives from DSMZ/ATCC. Store at +4 °C.

Step 2 – Revive each strain separately (week 1)  
→ Add 1 mL sterile water → streak on agar plate → 3 days growth.

Step 3 – Make seed cultures (week 2)  
→ 9 separate 1-L flasks → grow 48–72 h at 25–30 °C.

Step 4 – Big brew (week 3–4)  
→ Inoculate all 9 seed cultures into one 500 L fermenter.  
→ Recipe: 1 % glucose, 0.5 % yeast extract, pH 6.8–7.2, 25 °C, gentle aeration for 5–7 days.  
→ Final density ~10¹⁰ cells/mL total.

Step 5 – Harvest & dry (week 5)  
→ Centrifuge or settle → mix wet biomass 50/50 with wheat bran or vermiculite carrier.  
→ Option A: Freeze-dry (best survival)  
→ Option B: Spray-dry at <45 °C (cheaper)  
→ Final product: brown granules, shelf-stable 1–2 years at room temp.

Step 6 – Final mix  
→ Weigh equal dry weight of all 9 strains → tumble-mix in clean drum → bag it.  
→ 1 kg treats ~100 m² at 1 cm depth (adjust as needed).

Done. You now have “Ocean’s Novem Granules” ready to sprinkle or inject.

Safety: All steps = Containment Level 1. Autoclave waste. Wear gloves.
