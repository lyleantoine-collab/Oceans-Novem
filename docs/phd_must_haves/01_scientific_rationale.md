# Scientific Rationale – Why Ocean’s Novem Actually Works

1. Synergistic pathway coverage: aerobic oxidative attack (fungi + Pseudomonas) → chain shortening → anaerobic reductive defluorination (Dehalococcoides) → mineralization  
2. Cold-climate validated strains (Fixed Earth, MUN theses)  
3. Indigenous-led, open-source, KISS design → maximum adoption potential  
4. Zero secondary waste (unlike sorption methods)
