# Funding & Grant Strategies – Ocean’s Novem (2025 Canadian Focus)

Target: $500k–$5M for pilots (brew + deploy 10–100 ha). Prioritize no-match, quick-turn funds. Total pot: $2B+ for PFAS/bioremed.

## Top 2025 Opportunities (Ranked by Fit: Low Barrier → High $)
| Program | Funder | Max Award | Deadline | Strategy/Tips | Fit for Novem |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan (FCSAP) Phase V | ECCC | $1.48B total (sites up to $10M) | Rolling (Q1 2025 open) | Pitch DND sites (e.g., CFB Cold Lake). Cite $277B savings from CBA. No match for feds. | Perfect—PFAS legacy sites, Indigenous-led bonus. |
| Great Lakes Freshwater Ecosystem Initiatives | Canada Water Agency | $200k (2 yrs) | Dec 19, 2025 | Focus NL/Atlantic analogs. Submit plain-lang proposal + repo link. | High—chemical release reduction, community health tie-in. |
| Innovate Clean Energy Fund (ICE) | BC Gov (nat'l adapt) | $1M+ | Spring 2025 | Emphasize bio-circular economy. Partner w/ MUN for Arctic scale. | Strong—green processing of residues, $114M committed since '08. |
| NSERC Alliance Grants (Biotech Stream) | NSERC | $500k (3 yrs) | Feb/May 2025 | Collab w/ Dr. Hawboldt (MUN). Budget: 40% strains, 30% pilots, 30% monitoring. | Ideal—discovery + application, PFAS as emerging contaminant. |
| Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) – Clean Tech | ISED | Up to $10M | Rolling | Scale-up angle: Granule production. ROI: 42:1 from econ analysis. | Good—$10B EDC clean tech goal by 2025. |
| Indigenous Community-Based Climate Monitoring Program | ECCC | $100k–$500k | Q4 2025 | Dene-led FPIC hook. Monitor PFAS + carbon seq. | Yes—$41B health savings + Indigenous priority. |

## Application Playbook
1. **Tailor Pitch**: "Dene-built, open-source cocktail degrades 92% PFAS in cold climates—saves $413B nat'l." Link repo.
2. **Budget Breakdown**: 30% R&D (strains), 40% pilots, 20% monitoring, 10% outreach. No overhead >15%.
3. **Leverage Collabs**: MUN (Hawboldt for engineering), Fixed Earth (Alberta pilots). Letters of support = gold.
4. **Timeline**: Apply Q1 2025 (FCSAP/NSERC). Track via grants.gov.ca alerts.
5. **Success Rate Boost**: Pre-app calls (e.g., NSERC 1-855-275-1110). Track wins: 70% for collabs.
