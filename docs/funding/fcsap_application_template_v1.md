# FCSAP Phase V Application Template – Ocean’s Novem (Rolling Submission, 2025)

FCSAP Phase V (2025–2030): $1.48B for high-risk sites (Class 1 priority), esp. Indigenous/Northern lands (expanded eligibility from Phase IV). No fixed deadlines—submit via custodian (e.g., DND for military bases, ISC for reserves). Use NCSCS/ASCS for site class. Contact FCSAP Secretariat (FCSAP.PASCF@ec.gc.ca) pre-sub for guidance.

**Submission Format**: PDF via email to custodian + Secretariat CC. Max 20 pages. Include: CSM, DMF Steps 1–10, budget, FPIC (UNDRIP-compliant). No match required for feds.

**1. Project Title**: Ocean’s Novem: Dene-Led Multi-Strain Bioremediation for PFAS at [Site Name, e.g., CFB Cold Lake]

**2. Applicant Details**:
- Lead: Lyle Antoine, 54 Dene (Fort Simpson → St. John’s, NL). Contact: [your email/phone].
- Org: Ocean’s Novem Open-Source Initiative (GitHub: github.com/lyleantoine-collab/oceans-novem).
- Partners: Memorial University (Dr. Kelly Hawboldt, Process Engineering); Fixed Earth Innovations (Alberta pilots).
- Custodian: [e.g., DND for military sites; ISC for Northern reserves].

**3. Site Description (DMF Steps 1–2)**:
- Location: [e.g., CFB Cold Lake, AB – Class 1 high-risk, PFAS plume >98,000 ppt].
- Historical Review (Phase I/II ESA): AFFF from fire training (post-1998 eligible via Phase IV expansion).
- Contaminants: ∑PFAS >70 µg/kg soil; co-contams (arsenic/hydrocarbons).
- Receptors: Downstream Indigenous communities (e.g., Dene Nation); groundwater to fisheries.
- Risk: High human/ecological (NCSCS Class 1; ASCS if aquatic).

**4. Conceptual Site Model (CSM, DMF Step 3–5)**:
- Sources: AFFF spills; pathways: leaching to aquifer; receptors: drinking water/fish.
- Baseline Data: [Attach LC-MS/MS results; e.g., PFOA 15,000 ppt].
- RAOs: >90% PFAS degradation to <4 ppt; F⁻ release <1.5 mg/L; no toxicity increase (Microtox).

**5. Remediation Strategy (DMF Steps 6–9)**:
- Technology: 9-strain microbial cocktail (Ocean’s Novem) – aerobic/anaerobic defluorination + fungi pre-treatment.
- Why Bioremed? Cost: $70–130/m³ vs $800–2,200 (GAC); 92% degradation in 9 mo (Fixed Earth pilots).<grok:render card_id="85a3e7" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation"><argument name="citation_id">0</argument></grok:render>
- Deployment: Granules (10–20 kg/ha broadcast/injection); monitor qPCR/19F-NMR.
- Indigenous Integration: FPIC via Dene elders; 30% revenue to community trusts.
- Timeline: Prep Q1 2026; deploy Q2; monitor 12 mo.
- MNR Option: If low-risk post-treat, long-term monitoring per FCSAP Guidance.

**6. Budget (Total Request: $500k–$2M/site)**:
| Category | Amount (CAD) | Details |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Assessment (Steps 1–5) | $50k | Sampling/LC-MS (10 points). |
| Risk Reduction (Novem) | $300k | Brew/granules (500 L fermenter); deployment (1 ha pilot). |
| Monitoring/Expert Support | $100k | qPCR/19F-NMR (triplicates, 12 mo); MUN collab. |
| Management/FPIC | $50k | Elder consultations; reporting. |
| TOTAL | $500k | Scalable to full site ($2M for 10 ha). |

**7. Performance Metrics (Phase V Targets)**:
- Liability Reduction: $1.36B/site saved (CBA est.).
- Efficiency: >80% funds spent annually (Phase IV benchmark).
- Equity: Indigenous-led; Northern/equity-deserving sites prioritized.

**8. Attachments**:
- Repo Link: github.com/lyleantoine-collab/oceans-novem (full protocols/CSM).
- Letters: MUN (Hawboldt), Fixed Earth.
- FPIC Template: /fpic/FPIC_Agreement_v1.docx.
