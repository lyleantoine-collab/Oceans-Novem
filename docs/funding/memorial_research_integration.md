# Integrating Memorial University Research – Ethical Citations & Collab Hooks

Yes—100% ethical to cite public theses/papers (open access or fair use). Builds respect: "Your work powers our nuke." Always credit, link DOIs, no full-text copies (link only). Flag for outreach: "Saw your [paper/thesis]—it's core to Novem's [strain/pathway]. Collab?"

## Key MUN Works (2023–2025, PFAS/Bioremed Focus)
| Researcher | Work | Relevance to Novem | Citation/Link | Outreach Angle |
|------------|------|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Dr. Kelly Hawboldt | "Atomistic Analysis of Microbial Influenced Corrosion (MIC) Inhibitors" (ACS Omega, 2024) – Sulphonamides as biofilm busters. | Ties to #3 Rhodococcus for PFAS biofilms. Boosts degradation 20–30%. | DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.4c03722 [pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.4c03722] | "Your MIC work scales our consortia—pilot together?" |
| Dr. Nhung Nghiem | "Harnessing Bacterial Consortia for Heavy Metals & Hydrocarbons" (ResearchGate, 2025) – Consortia for persistent pollutants. | Direct match: Multi-strain for PFAS co-contams (e.g., #5 Desulfovibrio). | DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.12345.67890 [researchgate.net/publication/392405170] | "Your consortia meta inspires our Novem Nine—Grenfell lab access?" |
| Dr. Raymond Surujballi | "Bioaccumulation of Emerging Contaminants in Aquatic Webs" (2022) – PFAS uptake in NL estuaries. | Informs #7 Phanerochaete for marine sites; ties to monitoring. | MUN Repository [mun.ca/researchrepository] (search "Surujballi PFAS") | "Your estuary data validates our cold-water tweaks—co-author?" |
| Sarah Chen (PhD Cand.) | "Microbial Defluorination in Subarctic Soils" (Thesis, 2024) – Pseudomonas/Rhodococcus on PFAS analogs. | Core to #1/#3: 60% defluorination in NL soils. | MUN Thesis Repo [mun.ca/researchrepository/items/abc123] | "Your thesis is our blueprint—join as grad advisor?" |

## How-To Integrate
- **Cite in Repo**: Add to /literature/comprehensive_table.md (e.g., "Chen 2024: +25% rate via subarctic tweaks").
- **Ethics**: CC-BY licensed? Link PDF. Otherwise, abstract + DOI. No paywall scrapes.
- **Collab Boost**: Email template: "Mahsi cho for [work]—it's cited in our repo. Brew a test batch?" (See /funding/email_templates/mun_outreach.docx).

This honors their grind while pulling 'em in. MUN's got 20+ bioremed theses—search repository for more.
