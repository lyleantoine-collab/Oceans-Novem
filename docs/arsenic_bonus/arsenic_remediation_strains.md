# Bonus: If the site also has arsenic (common at military bases)

These three play nice with the Novem cocktail and eat arsenic too:

| Strain                        | Mechanism                          | Source (same suppliers)     |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans  | Oxidizes As(III) → As(V) (less toxic) | DSMZ 17147                  |
| Shewanella sp. ANA-3          | Reduces As(V) → precipitates out   | ATCC BAA-1095               |
| Bacillus selenitireducens     | Turns arsenate into solid form     | ATCC 700514                 |

Just add 1–2 of these → your mix now cleans PFAS + arsenic in one shot.
