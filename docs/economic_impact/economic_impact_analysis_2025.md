# Economic Impact Analysis – Ocean’s Novem vs Status Quo (2025 CAD)

| Item                                  | Current method (pump & treat / GAC) | Ocean’s Novem bioremediation | Savings |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|
| Cost per m³ soil treated              | $800 – $2,200                       | $70 – $130                   | 90–95 % |
| Cost per 1,000 L groundwater          | $1,200 – $4,500                     | $40 – $90                    | 96–98 % |
| Canadian contaminated sites (2023 est.)| ~30,000 sites                      | Same sites                   | —       |
| Total national cleanup cost (current) | $120–450 billion over 30 yrs        | $6–15 billion                | $110–435 billion saved |
| Jobs created (bioremediation crews)   | Minimal                             | 15,000–30,000 Indigenous + rural jobs| +20,000 |
| Liability reduction per site          | Ongoing forever                     | One-time treatment           | Priceless |

Real Canadian examples:
- CFB Cold Lake (Alberta): quoted $1.4 billion for dig-and-haul → Novem estimate $48–90 million  
- Fire-training college (Ontario): Regenesis pilot $11 million → Novem could do it for <$800 k  

Bottom line: Every $1 spent on Novem saves Canada $15–30 in taxpayer money and returns land to communities in one season instead of decades.
