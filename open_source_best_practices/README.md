# Open-Source Best Practices – Ocean’s Novem (Nov 2025)

Per GitHub Docs & Linux Foundation: README, LICENSE (MIT done), CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CITATION.cff, .gitignore (for large FASTQ files), branch protection on main (require PR reviews), automated Dependabot for deps (if we add scripts), and topics: pfas, bioremediation, microbial-consortia, indigenous-led.

Forking for outsiders; branching for collabs. No self-hosted runners—public repo security maxed.
